    "Fix your mental health, because it is in shit. You are too focused in your head, about what other people think, their judgment, in your own head critisizing every move, just do not think. Go out of your mind, take a walk, sense the fresh air, feek the touch, meditate purposly at least 3 minutes to clear the head.",
    "Qinhua application is in confusion. So ask in Wechat the recommendation despite sounding dumb, clear the confusion, if you choose in the end of December, then rush your shit, write to the KK about the recommendation letter, make the video, focus on it. If till the February, then focus on learning Chinese, because you MUST pass HSK 4, which is fucking hard man, but also spend one day to finish everything for the perfection. Right now it is not the priority.",
    "You long for the human touch and connection, but just stop giving shit about it. Watch some videos, but zabei bolt na eto. I have no outside help, nobody can help me."
